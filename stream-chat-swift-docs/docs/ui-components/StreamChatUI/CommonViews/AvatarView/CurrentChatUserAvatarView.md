# CurrentChatUserAvatarView

A UIControl subclass that is designed to show the avatar of the currently logged in user.

``` swift
public typealias CurrentChatUserAvatarView = _CurrentChatUserAvatarView<NoExtraData>
```

It uses `CurrentChatUserController` for its input data and is able to update the avatar automatically based
on the currently logged-in user.

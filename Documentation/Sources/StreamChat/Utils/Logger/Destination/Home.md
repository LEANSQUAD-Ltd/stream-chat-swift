# Types

  - [BaseLogDestination](/BaseLogDestination):
    Base class for log destinations. Already implements basic functionaly to allow easy destination implementation.
    Extending this class, instead of implementing `LogDestination` is easier (and recommended) for creating new destinations.
  - [ConsoleLogDestination](/ConsoleLogDestination):
    Basic destination for outputting messages to console.
  - [LogLevel](/LogLevel):
    Log level for any messages to be logged.
    Please check [this Apple Logging Article](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/logging/generating_log_messages_from_your_code) to understand different logging levels.
  - [LogDetails](/LogDetails):
    Encapsulates the components of a log message.

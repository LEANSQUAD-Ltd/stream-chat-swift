# ChatChannelMemberListControllerDelegate

`ChatChannelMemberListController` uses this protocol to communicate changes to its delegate.

``` swift
public protocol ChatChannelMemberListControllerDelegate: DataControllerStateDelegate 
```

This protocol can be used only when no custom extra data are specified. If you're using custom extra data types,
please use `_ChatChannelMemberListControllerDelegate` instead.

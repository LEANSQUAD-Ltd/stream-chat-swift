# ChatChannelMemberController

`ChatChannelMemberController` is a controller class which allows mutating and observing changes of a specific chat member.

``` swift
public typealias ChatChannelMemberController = _ChatChannelMemberController<NoExtraData>
```

`ChatChannelMemberController` objects are lightweight, and they can be used for both, continuous data change observations,
and for quick user actions (like ban/unban).

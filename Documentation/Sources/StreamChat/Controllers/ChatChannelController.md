# ChatChannelController

`ChatChannelController` is a controller class which allows mutating and observing changes of a specific chat channel.

``` swift
public typealias ChatChannelController = _ChatChannelController<NoExtraData>
```

`ChatChannelController` objects are lightweight, and they can be used for both, continuous data change observations (like
getting new messages in the channel), and for quick channel mutations (like adding a member to a channel).
